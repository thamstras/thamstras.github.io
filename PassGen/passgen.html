	<p>PassGen, a (probably) cryptographically secure password generator.</p>
	<p>Accepts as command line arguments -c, -l and -m.</p>
	<p>-c is how many passwords to generate, -l is the length of passwords to generate and -m is which character sets to use. 1 = upper/lower case letters, 2 = numbers, 4 = special characters.</p>
	<p>Recommended modes are 3 (alphanumeric) or 7 (all allowed characters)</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>For reasons which I hope are obvious, no pre-compiled binary is available.</p>
	<p>Source Code is here: <a href="files\PassGen.cs">PassGen.cs</a></p>
