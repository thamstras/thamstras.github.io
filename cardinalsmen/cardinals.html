	<p>Here you can find my java implimentation of The Three Muskateers game from Marc LeBlanc's GDC workshops (and my Games Programming lectures...)</p>
	<p>For those who haven't heard of it, the rules are simple.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The board is 5x5</li>
		<li>Muskateers start in the top right, center, and bottom left squares.</li>
		<li>All other squares start with one of the Cardinal's men in them.</li>
		<li>You must make a move if you can.</li>
		<li>The Musketeer player starts.</li>
		<li>Players take turns to move one piece.</li>
		<li>Musketeers can move to any non-diagonal adjacent square which is occupied by an opponent piece. That piece is removed.</li>
		<li>Cardinal's men can move to any non-diagonal adjacent square.</li>
		<li>The Cardinal's men win if the three musketeers are captured: that is, <b>they are aligned on the same row or column.</b></li>
		<li>The musketeers win if <b>they cannot move</b> due to there being no enemy pieces adjacent to any musketeer. (and they are not all on the same row or column, of course)</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<p>NOTE: The program doesn't check if anyone has actually won. That's comming in a future update...</p>
